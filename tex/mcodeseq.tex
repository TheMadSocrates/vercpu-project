\label{subsec:microseq}
The microcode sequencer utilizes the output from both the microcode ROM
(section \ref{subsec:microcode_rom}) and the instruction decoder (section
\ref{subsec:idecoder}) in order to issue the next microoperation. The
sequencer's logic is purely combinational in nature and consists of mainly one
multiplexer.
