\label{subsec:microcode_rom}
A microcode ROM is implemented to be used by the sequencer in the instruction
decoder. The ROM contains the micro-operations to be performed when executing
every instruction. A horizontal microcode implementation is chosen, as it
provides flexibilty whilst keeping complexity to a minimum. In a horizontal
implementation, each bit of the microinstruction encodes the value of a
particular control line for the datapath. This, in practice is a way to
abstract the state machine used in the control unit, providing also the ability
to easily add instructions.\par

The table in Appendix \ref{app:mcrom} shows the contents of
the ROM with the associated instruction and the offset.
