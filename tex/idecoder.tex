\label{subsec:idecoder}
The instruction decoder acts as an offset table into the microcode ROM (section
\ref{subsec:microcode_rom}), pointing to the start of the set of
microoperations that are to be executed to complete the desired operation.
Conditional branches are evaluated at this point as well, with the offset for
branch failed and branch taken computed within the unit. During the instruction
decode stage, the microcode sequencer (section \ref{subsec:microseq})
utilizes the offset from the instruction decoder to redirect control to the
proper offset on the ROM table.
