The following is a report on the design and implementation of a simple CPU architecture using the Verilog HDL. It includes an explanation of the objectives of the project, as well as an in-depth look at the implementation methods used for the datapath, including the arithmetic logic unit, memory, and various registers, and control path, including the instruction decoder, microcode ROM implementation, and various control lines. The complete Verilog source code of the CPU is also included in Section \ref{sec:rtl}. Diagrams of both the top-level and the datapath are included for reference and understanding of how the system connects. Also included are a few waveforms from simulating the design in ISim in order to show that the implementation works, presented in Appendix \ref{app:testbench}.
