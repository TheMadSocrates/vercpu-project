The processor implements a simple instruction set on an accumulator
architecture. That is, there is only one working register on the unit.
Instruction timings range from 1 clock cycle to 4 clock cycles in execution,
whilst fetching and decoding are one cycle each. The processor is not
pipelined, as such, an instruction must finish executing before the next one is
fetched. Table \ref{tb:iset} in Appendix \ref{app:proc_iset} defines the
instruction set of the processor.
