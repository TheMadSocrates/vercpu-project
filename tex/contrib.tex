Orlando Arias designed the general architecture of the CPU, deciding on a
microcode implementation. He posed the design parameters and built the
configurable CPU datapath. He was also tasked with the creation of preliminary
testbenchs for the developed modules. Orlando also ported the finalized
version of the CPU to his Digilent Nexys 3 board.\par

David Mascenik performed most of the work on the control unit, developing and
optimizing the microcode parameters whilst still giving feedback on the design
of the datapath for ease of instruction creation and implementation. He was
also responsible for running and refining the testing mechanisms for the CPU.
David performed some of the research tasks necessary for the implementation of
the sequencer.\par
